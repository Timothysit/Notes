# Glia (Karadottir)
## Questions 

Summary questions: 

- What are the functons of glia cells are what are the evidence for/against it (this may be too general, but you can try to do an outline)
- Discuss the role of Glia in metabolic support (specifically glucose)
- What is the evidence that astrocytes form networks? 


Genuine questions: 

- what were the main points of the first lecture? 

## Introduction to glial cells, and astrocytes
### Summary

### Some background and history

matters in the brain: 

- 50% grey matter (computation)
- 50% white matter (information transmission)

shown to be optimal architecture (Really?)

Around 99% of axon is covered by myelin 

Rudolf Virchow, who coined the term glial, thought glial cells is just "glue-like" substances. And so most people would rather study neurons instead. 

Otto Deiter was one of the guys who discovered astrocytes (but NOT the only guy). 

Pio del Rio Hortega used silver carbonate staining to study microglia and oligodendrocytes. He thought glia is vital for neuron survival, but was thrown out of the lab by Cajal. 

Studying the electrical properties of neurons and glia using the voltage clamp

- non-linear in neurons; current and voltage non-linear relationship, suggest ion channels
- linear in glia: nothing intresting? (ie. glia seem to be ohmic $V = IR$, passive cells)

Calcium dye first gave insight into function of glial cells 

- addition of glutamate result in "glowing up" of astrocytes, suggesting there is a calcium wave (and perhaps some signallling properties?)
- then we look in astrocytes in hippocampal slices, and we also see calcium signalling 


### Function of glia 


Summarising recent findings: 

- electrophysiology and calcium imaging show **functional astrocytic networks** 
- connected by connexins 30/43
- they have glutamate receptors 
- they can release glutamate? (V. controversial)
- if you change calcium conc. in glial cell, you **influence neuronal excitablity** (how? Changing calcium level in neurons? glutamate release?)



the blood-brain barrier 

- regulate what goes from blood to brain
- eg. too much glutamate in the blood for the brain to handle
- glial cells are connected to blood vessels; regulate dilation/constriction, and inflow/outflow of substances. This regulation is responsible for fMRI BOLD signals 

astrocytes are also important in regulating synaptic transmission (at the synapse)


- **tripartite synapse**
- terminating synaptic transmission by taking up glutamate 
- convert glutamate to glutamine, then give this to presynaptic cell, which can convert it back to glutamate 
- soidum/potassium pump results in potassium extracellulary, this is taken up by astrocytes. (Low extracellular potassium is required for high-frequency transmission. But why?)

Lactate shuttle hypothesis: 

- astrocyte take up glucose from the capillary, then convert it to lactate
- neuorns need lactate to make ATP 
- but there are papers that are questioning this hypothesis 


astrocyte also interact with post-synapse: 

- release D-serine, co-activator of NMDAR (double check)
- but still some controversy over this 


two-photon microscopy also shed some light on astrocyte function 

- 2P- in vivo imaging GCamp5 expressed in astrocytes 
- could be in response to neuron activity 

The classical view of two majro cell types in CNS: neurons and macroglia (astocytes and oligodendrocytes), suggest a clear divide in function 


| Neurons | Macroglia |
|---------|-----------|
|         |           |

However, there are papers that suggest that astrocytes are involved in information processing

this is suggsetd by experiments showing that knocking out parts of glial cell affect behavioural/cognitive functions in mice: 

- if you knock out receptor in astrocyte, there is memory loss (Han 2012)
- motor coordination 
- impaired basic brain function 
- sleep disturbance 

but some are very controversial 

A fun experiment: 

- take out *human astrocyte* from embryo
- culture and put into mice 
- human astorcyte take over, pretty much everywhere in the brain
- LTP more maintained. post-synaptic current larger 
- astrocyte more integrated in network, longer processes 
- "intelligence" behavioural test: they are more clever, eg. learn aversive stimuli faster. Better at dicrimination tasks

Some evidence of altered glia in disease: 

- Fibroblast form Schizophrenic children and from control 
- induce to pluripotent state, then derive to glial cells 
- put into mice 
- mice with schizoprenic fibroblast showed behaviour similar to schizophrenia 

How to explain all of this? 

- there is evidence that astrocyte regulate neural development 
- release proline ? to? 
- decide which synapses should be eliminated (synaptic pruning)

this suggest that it may be the *development* of synaptic transmission that is affected, NOT synaptic transmission itself. (This is just one possible explanation)


Astrocyte were once viewed to be "bad" cells affecting neurons 

- **glial scar** is one major focus in spinal cord injury 
- preventing glial scar may help neuron regeneration 
- some group produced STAT3-CKO, which prevented formation of glial-scar, but fond that the injury actually became *larger*. This changed the view that astrocyte is doing something bad, they are containing the injury at the cost of preventing regeneration 

The **glymphatic system**

- sleep drives metabolite clearance from the adult brain
- when asleep, the dye is flushed out 
- efflux to the lymphatic system 
- suggestsed that Alzheimer's due to lack of efflux due to lack of sleep 





## Rio-Hortega's glial cells - microglia and oligodendrocytes 


some history: 

- del Rio-Hortega described microglia as "body guards" of neurons 
- he found that microglia in diseased brain looked different from WT 
- he thought microglia 1. cleans up and 2. repair 
- but he also thought they are "monsters" (why? what is this?)
- microglia accounts for 10% of the cells in the brain
- they behaves like macrophages in response to disease 

Where do microglia come from? 

- thought to come from the bastula tube (but debated)
- from very restricted area in yolk sac early in development 
- NOT from purple macrophages (as thought)

Microglia development

- they develop by ramificating (increasing branches) 
- eventually they become quiscent (alhtough they are not quiet per say, this may not be the most appropriate term)


What do microglia do?

- repair
    + send process to injury site (therefore they are not "resting")
    + shown to be attracted to ATP, and this may be the mechanism for detecting injury
- immune system? 
    + there are both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory verrsion of the cell 
    + activate other immune system cells
    + but can cause edma and increase in neurotoxicity

See Davalos 2005 Nature Neuroscience
See Nayak 2014 Ann. Rev. Immuno 

Not peer reviewed, just for fun (don't write this in the exam): 

- eating up neural processes 
- translocating neurons (deciding which neuron talk to which?)


There may be roles of microglia beyond surveying and responding to damage. There is suggesting that it can alter **behaviour**, but strongly debated.

- Chen et al (2010 Cell) found that mutant microglia in brain (Hoxb8 mutant) changed the behaviour of mouse: excessive grooming behaviour 
- Bone marrow transplant from WT restore normla behaviour 
- may be related to **Rett syndrome**, but very debated 
    + WT microglia arrest pathology in mouse model of Rett syndrome 
    + BUT also published: WT microglia do not reverse pathology in mouse models of Rett syndrome

There is the suggestion that behaviour may be affected by how mouse was raised. Eg. cleaniness of the facility, etc. 

Other potential roles of microglia: 

- synapse elimination via synaptic pruning

lecturer suggests that most of the advertised roles of microglia in behaviour and function etc. may just be due to the role of microglia in development 
ie. microglia malfunction --> abnormal development --> abnormal function 


A way to test this: what happens if you kill microglia in adults? 

- there is effect on **synaptic structual plasticity**


#### Oligodendrocytes 

What do oligodendrocytes do?

- wrap around neurons, myelinate the axons of the CNS (therefore responsible for the white matter of the brain)
- they *produce* myelin (via electron microscope 1962)


Functional anatomy of olligodendrocytes (really not sure what is described here)

- oligodedrocytes have a growth cone 
- cytoplasmic channels between compacted area 
- compaction may be related to remodelling of myelin 

Mouse without myelin: 

- mouse without myelin show shivering behaviour, then die
- some also show jumpy behaviour

(Not sure what is the significance of this equation)

$$
g_{\text{ratio}} = \frac{A_d}{T_d}
$$

where: 

- $A_d$ is the axon diameter 
- $T_d$ is the total diamter (myelin and axon)


function of myleination: 

- increase propagation time (same as moving from a Ferrari to a space shuttle before and after myelination)


morre function of oligodendrocytes: 

- provide neuron axons with metabolic / tropic supoport (Funfschilling et al Nature 2012)
- not clear how this happpens
- but should be similar to what happens between astrocytes and neurons 


Killing oligodendrocytes in adults: 

- neurodegenration, ie. neurons start to die 
- microglia activation (what does that do? Phagocytose things?)
- myelin destruction happens in many diseases 

Myelin can be **regenerated** 
(one of the few things in the brain that can be regenerated)

- first reported by Bunge 1968 Physiol Rev. 

But how? 


## White matter - NG2 glia, myleination, 


classical (and current?) (re)view of information processing in brain:

- white matter: information transmission 
- grey matter: compututation 
- maximise neural connectivity 

![Myelin is made by oligodendrocyte precuror cells](https://i.imgur.com/IvT4M7W.png)

- dots are progenitor cells 
- they have stem-cell like properties


Oligodendrocyte precuor cells is a relatively recent discovery (1986)

- they are the main proliferative cell in the CNS (make new cells)
- in adults, they account for 5% of cell population 
- cell differentiate and myleinate axons 
    + but often fail (in adults)
    + threrefore current focus in therapy is to get them to do that reliably 

some "shocks" about OPCs 

- OPCs get direct synaptic input from axons (from neurons?)
- only unmyelinated axons synapse on OPCs (but strongly debated)
    + we are sure unmyelinated axons do 
    + but we are not sure if myelianted axons do 
- OPCs fire AP upon current injection (Karadottir Nat Neuro. 2008, but strongly argued, therefore perhaps don't mention too strongly in essay)
- knockdown of voltage-gated Na+ Channel in OPCs reduce myelination 
    + suggests that there is some signalling going on to regulate myelination (Paez 2009 J. Neurosci)

sleep 

(didn't catch any of that)


What is the importance of myelin? 

- increase conduction speed
- differnetial myleination can regualte AP in such a way that two neurons firing to another neuron from different distance have their signal arrive at the same time 
- may aid in synaptic plasticity 
- seen in auditory system: conincidence detection? (Sedi 2014, Neuroscience)

How is myelination regulated? 

- don't know yet 

There is diversity in how neurons are myelinated: 

- "zebra-pattern" (myelinate, no myelinate)
- one chunk myelinated, another not 
- why? 


Is myleination a dynamic process? 

- there is increase myelinat with age (up to 60)
- pianist practice hours (during childhood only) linear relationship with corpus collasum (myelination?)
- in adults: change in white matter when adults learn to juggle, suggested to due to myelination 
- activity-dependent myelination in mice visual system

there may be two myelination programs 

(what are they? One that is fixed during development and one that is dynamic?)

more about activity-dependent myelination: 

- some evidence that it comes later (adulthood)
- socially and emotionally deprived children
    + taken to foster home / care at different time of development 
    + there is change in white matter
    + there is a critical point after which care won't help 
- similar found in mice 
    + isolate mice (socially) --> no myelination in PFC
    + what is the phenotype of this? 


What is the functional role of new myelin? 

- motor learning (McKenzie 2014, Science)
    + mice without myelination cannot run in "complex wheel" properly 
    + the complex wheel consists of only a few bars that you can step on (otherwise you fall out of the wheel)

Summary of function of glial cells 

|       Glia       | Function |
|------------------|----------|
| astrocytes       |          |
| microglia        |          |
| oligodendrocytes |          |
| OPCs             |          |


## Discussion / Supervision 

will loss of myelination in adulthood lead to loss of function? 

- yes, loss of hearing if auditory cortex
- if cerebellum, loss of balance 

oligodendrocytes vs astrocytes? 

- oligodendrocytes may not be communicating with each other
- unlike astrocytes, which forms network 

in healthy adults, what causes demyelination? 

- demyelination normally does NOT occur with healthy adults
- myelination / olgidedndrocytes are very sensitive 
- very, very few people have demyelination triggered by vacination 
- new oligodendrocytes are being formed throughout life, myelinating neurons 
- therefore myelination may be maintained through constant replacement 
- BUT there is a study (Swedish) 
    + atomic bomb --> change in carbon isotopes
    + allows them to date neurons
    + they found that oligodendrocytes in adult brain, is mainly from when you are a child (about 5), only about 5% is new 
    + therefore can't really say to what extent there is "maintenance"
    + possibility: there don't divide, they differentiate (so no loss of )

difference between oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells 

|    Oligodendrocyte     |     Schwann cell     |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| CNS                    | PNS                  |
| myelinate 50 - 60 axon | myelinate one axon   |
|                        | multiple roles       |
|                        | can de-differentiate |
| thinner myelination    | thicker myelination  |
| processes differ       | processes differ     |


something about Chen et al paper in lecture 2

- paper result: no bone marrow, no microglia 
- BUT bone marrow don't produce microglia right? 
- the prooblem may be due to breaking blood-brain barrier 



## Literature 


### Clarke 2013: Emerging roles of astrocytes in neural circuit development 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23595014

main points: 

- astrocyte is important for synapse development (formation and function)
- they secrete special molecules to do this (some identified)

There are 3 stages of neural circuit formation 

1. immature synapse form between axons and dendrites 
2. synapse undergo maturation: conversion of **silent synapse** to active ones 


How, and what aspect of synapse formation is regulated by astrocytes? 

properties of astrocu=ytes: 

- they make extensive connectinos: a single rodent astrocyte can contact up to 100,000 synapses 
- they have ion channels and receptors, and can therefore respond to neurotransmitters and other cues


List of syanptogenic molceules secreted by astrocytes: 

|      synaptogenic molecule       |       Effect (in short)       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Brain-derived neuotrophic factor | vestibular sensory epithelium |
| Cholestorol                      | excitatory synapses           |
| Ephrins                          | Dendritic spine dynamics      |
| Glypican                         | synapse formation             |
| Hevin                            | size of synapses              |
| SPARC                            | antagonise hevin              |
| Thrombosondins (TSPs)            | excitatory synapses           |
| TGF$\beta$ 1                     | excitatory synapses           |


#### Secreted signal control excitatory synapse formation

- first evidence of this based on studying rodent retinal ganglion cells 
- RGC is generally a good model for studying synapse development
    + (perhaps because the synapse has to form quite specific conncetions)
    + also because cells can be immunopurified and cultured for weeks without other cell types (what is immunopurification?)

a RGC experiment: 

- culture RGC without astrocyte (control)
- culture RGC with astrocytes 
- observation: neurons form 10 times more excitatory synapses 
- synaptic functionality also increased (what does this mean?) 

*in vitro* studies confirm that similar things happen in other parts of the nervous system 


Examples of some of the molecules secreted by astrocytes and their mechanism: 

**Apolipoprotein E** bound to cholestorol 

- cholestorol enhance preysynaptic differentiation in RGC 
- this is done by increasing the release capaity of individual synapse 
- and this is done through increasing synthesis and maturation of synaptic vesicles (but how?)

**Thrombospondins** (TSP)

- large extracellular matrix proteins secreted by cultured astrocytes 
- TSP1 and TSP2 promote formation of excitatory synapses 
- supporting evidence: immunodepeletion (what is this?) of TSP1 and TSP2 from astrocyte-conditioned medium inhibited synapse-inducing effect of astrocytes 

Mechanism of TSPs

- TSP bind to the $\alpha_2 \delta -1$ subunit of the VGCa+C
- more specifically: binding of the TSP *type 2 epidermal growht factor-like repeats* to the *von willebrand factor type A domain* of the receptor triggers recruitemtn of synaptic adhesion and scaffolding molecules to synaptic sites 
- TSP also interacts with integrins and neuroligins for synapse formation 


Whilst TSPs are released only in the developing brain, hevin and SPARC continues to be released in the adult brain. 

- hevin regulates synapse number and size 
- hevin interacts with the pre/postsynaptic adhesion molecules neurexins and neuroligins 
- evidence of this interaction suggest that hevin induces excitatory synapse formation by clustering trans-synaptic adhesion molecules (by why specifically excitatory synapse, why can't it do the same for inhibitory synapses? What controls this specificity?)

[insert photo here]

SPARC may have roles in regulating strength of excitatory synapse (and therefore contribute to synaptic plasticity), evidence for this comes from: 

- studies showing that neural activity regulate SPARC experssion in astrocytes
- SPARC-null mice have defects in synaptic plasticity 

#### Astrocyte also control inhibitory synapse formation 

fun facts about development of synapses: 

- inhibitory synaes form *before* excitatory synapses 
- these inhibitory synapses intially form an *excitatory* network to determine neural circuit development (how?)

how astrocytes control development of inhibitory synapses: 

- secrete molecules to regulate pre/postsynaptic differentiation (I guess this means biasing differentiation so that a portion goes into inhibitory whilst others develop to become excitatory)

evidence that astrocyte countribute to develompent of inhibitory synapse: 

- culturing hippocampal neurons with astrocyte / astrocyte-conditioned medium (what does this mean? ie. astrocyte leaving checmicals behind?) --> increase amplitude and density of GABA A receptor currents (why not just count the number of GABA A receptors directly?) (Liu 1996 Journal of Neuroscience)


Is it a "balance" between excitatory and inhibitory? Or are they regulated independently? Current evidence suggest the latter. 

- TSP (promoter of excitatory synapses) depletion does not prevent inhibitory synaptogenesis 
- but other than that there seem to be not much evidence to swing other way 


#### Astrocyte contact controls synapse formation 

ie. astrocyte is not limited to using chemicals to influence neural development, but can also use direct contacts

experiment demonstrating this: (Hama 2004 Neuron)

- time-lapse imaging of hipopcampal neurons cultured on micro-islands of extracellular matrix proteins with astrocytes overlaid 
- local astrocyte contact led to increas in
    + presynaptic activity 
    + amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents 
    + overall number of excitatory synapses that formed among the neurons 

the mechanism behind this contact-based control: 

- astrocyte activates neuronal **integrin receptors**
- this is folllowed by activation of protein kinase C signalling cascade (what type of neuron is used in this study?)

BUT this is likely not to be the only mechanism:

- PKC signaling cascade is not sufficient/ncesary in retinal ganglion cells 
- this suggest that different mechanisms may be used for different neurons


#### Astrocyte control of synapse maturation 

TSP and hevin are NOT enough for excitatory synapse development: 

- they only allow structural formation 
- these synapses are postsynaptically silent because they lack AMPA receptors (ie. the structural framework is set up, but we still need one key component)
- astrocytes are also needed to promote *maturation* (which I think they mean by expression of AMPA receptors etc. to unsilence the synapse)

The molecules secreted by astrocyte to make functional excitatory synapse (ie. unsilence them?) are **glypicans** 

- they anchor to the extracellular side of the cell PM by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkages
- they are cleaved by phospholipases to release teh protein

evidence that glypicans stimulate development of functional excitatory synapse: 

- application of glypicans to purified RGCs was sufficient to increase the frequency and amplitude of glutamatergic synaptic events (Allen 2012 Nature)
- Glypican 4-deficient mice had defective synapse formatio, with decreased in amplitude fo excitatory postsynaptic currents in the developing hippocampus and reduction in recruitment of AMPAR to synapse (Allen 2012 Nature)

mechanism of glypicans: 

- increase surface expression and clutering of *GluA1* subunit of the AMPA receptor 
- glypicans may bind to the tryosine phosphatase receptor **leukocyte antigen-related receptor** (LAR) (This was shown in flies with a glypican 4 homolog, but not confirmed in humans etc. But suggested in mammals)
- overall more work to be done to identify the receptor of glypicans 

dendritic spine maturation (what is "dendritic spine"?)

![Dendritic spine ](https://neuwritesd.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angry-y-u-no.jpg?w=650){width=50%}


- dendritic spine = subcellular compartments containing the excitatory postsynaptic machinery 
- they change in response to neuronal activity / environmental changes 
    + in LTD, spine shrink and AMPAR are removed from PM --> decrease in synaptic strength 
    + LTP: spine expand and increase AMPAR expression 
- spines are dynamic during develompent but becomes more stable upon maturation 

there is intimate interaction between astrocytes and spine: 

- astrocyte processes (ie. astrocyte "hands") wrap around dendritic spines
- astrocyte remodel in response to dendritic spine remodelling 
- astrocyte might be important for stabilising spines 

some evidecne for the role of astrocyte in dendritic spine develompent

- larger and more stable spines were found to have more stable contacts with astrocytic processes 

skipped over some parts here

#### Astrocyte control of synapse pruning 

evidence that astrocyte is involved in synaptic pruning: 

- signals released from the astrocytes were found to induce the expression of the complement component of **C1q**, which is the initiating protein in the *classical complement cascade* (Stevens 2007 Cell)
- the role of C1q is to **opsonize** unwanted debris/cells for removal by phagocytiuc immune cells 
    + mice lkacing C1q/downsteram copmonents fail to exectue synapse elimination 

How do we know there is a deficit in synaptic pruning? 

- we use the **retinogeniculate system** as our model system 
- absence of anatomical refinement of the retinogeniculate connections (not exactly sure what this means, but general idea seem to be the growth is not like WT)
- excess retinal innvervations by lateral geniculate neurons 
- enhanced synaptic connectivity and epileptic activity in mice 


How do astrocyte control synaptic pruning? 

- release **synapse elimination signals**
- this then trigger expressin of complement component of **C1q**
- microglia (immune cells) express C1q and C3 receptors 

Synapse elimination by astrocytes 

- astrocyte may directly phagocytose neuronal debris and synapse 
- for example, phagocytic activity by astrocyte have been reported in respones to trauma (al-Ali 1996 J. Anat)
- some of this phagocytic activity may be due to experssion of phagocytososis-relaed gene (eg. **Mac-2**) by specific astrocytes 

There are 3 redundant pathways that active phagocytosis in astrocytes: 

1. CRKII pathway 
2. c-Mer tyrosine kinase receptor (MERTK) pathway 
3. RAC1-indepednent pathway 

(won't go into detail here as I think it may not be relevant / particularly interesting)


#### Implications for human health and disease 

won't go into too much detail here as I don't think it will be relevant to writing essays, even though it may be interesting. 

disorders related to astrocyte function: 

- autism 
- schizophrenia 
- anxiety disorder 
- depression 
- Rett syndrome 


Rett syndrome: 

- X-linked
- neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of transcriptional repressor MECP2
- WT hippocampal neurons cultured with astrocytes from MECP2-deficient mice had abnormally stunted dendrites (Ballas 2009 Nature Neuroscience)
- this suggest that MECP2-deficient astrocyte is affecting dendrite develompent

### Halassa 2010: Integrated Brain Circuits: Astrocytic Networks Modulate Neuronal Activity and Behavior.


- Astrocyte are capableof responding to neuronal activity and neurotransmitters
- astricyte can release gliotransmitters that act on neurons 

| gliotransmitter |              function             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| ATP             | modulate synaptic transmission    |
| D-serine        | modulate NMDA receptor function   |
| glutamate       | relapse following drug withdrawal |

Astrocytes are mediators of **neurovascular coupling** = coupling of neuronal activity to cerebral blood flow: 

- astrocytes are positioned between synapses and blood vessels

#### Astrocytic membrane properties support neuronal physiology 

astrocyte show changes in electrical property that suport neuronal activity:

- they express inward rectifier K+ (K~IR~) channels
    + greater tendency for K+ uptake than K+ export (ie. move K+ inside cell)
    + inward rectifier = channel taht psses current (positive charge) more easily in the inward directino (into the cell) than in the outward direction
    + this mainly help to stabilise the resting membrane potential of the cell
- these act to maintain the astrocytic membrane potential close the equilibiurm potential of K+ 
- when extracellular K+ rises, K+ ions flow into astrocyte through inward rectifiers (What is the function of this?)

- astrocytes also express Ca2+ activated K+ channels 
- this allow astrocytic Ca2+ signalling to result in release of K+ from astrytic endfeet onto blood vessles (what is the function of this?)

Electrical channels in astrocytes 

| channel |                      function                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| K~IR~   | maintain low [K+] outside neuron by taking them in |
| BK      | Ca2+ signalling for K+ release  to blood vessels   |


Neurotransmitter transporters in astrocytes facilatate synaptic transmission and recycling of these transmitters, these transporters deal with: 

- glutamate 
- GABA 
- glycine 

glutamate: 

- glutamate taken up by astrocytes 
- glutamine synthetase convert glutamate to glutamine 
- glutamine released to glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals (what is the function of this? Is there any evidence that it does anything to the terminals?)
    + it is suggested that releasing glutamine to GABAergic terminals allow inhibitory synaptic transmission and therefore allow astrocyte to shape neuronal activity / information processing 

#### Astrocytes form metabolic networks that respond to external stimuli 

- astrocyte form networks (of their own cell type I think) through gap junctions that contain connectin 43 and 30 
- glucose is taken up by endfeet of astrocytes and can diffuse through gap junctions 
- the delivery of glucose is dependent on neuronal activity

Evidence that such metabolic network exists (at least for transport of glucose): 

- delivering glucose to one astrocyte rescue synaptic activity when extracellular glucose is lowered 
- this pocess is inhibited by astrocye-specific genetic ablation of connexin 43 and 30 (where is the citation for this?)

How do astrocytes process glucose? 

- glucose stored as either glycogen or metabolised to lactate
- **lactate shuttle** = metabolic relationship between neurons and astrocytes 
    + can be modulated by sleep/wake cycle 
- glycogen metabolism is regualted by neural mechanisms 
    + noradrenaline --> astrocytic cAMP --> breakdown of intracellular glycogen 
 
#### Astrocytes exhibit Ca^2+^ excitability

How does astrocyte propagate calcium wave? 

- rely on activation of astrocytic metabotropic glutamate receptors
- Gq --> PLC --> DAG and IP3 --> Ca2+ from internal stores

What is the function of this calcium signalling? 

- activity-depednent neurovascular coupling (what this means is, I think, that glial cell make sure that nutrients are delivered to neurons with high activity)

There is suggestoin that there is network organisation of visual cortical astrocytes (Schummers J 2008, Science)

- they show sharper tuning to oreitnation and spatial frequency then neurons
- may play a role in tracking output of cortical pyramidal neurons s
- inhibiting astrocytic Ca2+ signalling in the visual cortex via increasing level of **isofluorane anesthesia** inhibit activity-dependent vascular response in visual cortex (ie. control of deilvery of nutrients?)

There is similar evidence for astrocyte Ca2+ signalling in the oflactory system

- it was found that olfacotry bulb astrocytes in the mouse respond to odor-evoked synaptic input (Petzold 2008, Neuron)
- their response conincide with vascular repsonse (what does this mean? ie. when they do calcium signalling, there is change in local blood pressure?)


Some suggestion that astrocyte regulatino may also play an "anticipatory" role (ie. direct blood flow based on where it expects will need it in the future), rather than being purely reactive.

#### Astrocytes release chemical transmitters to modulate neuronal activity 

Astrocytes release 3 main chemical transmitters: 

1. glutamate - modulate NMDA receptor function
2. D-serine - modulate synaptic plasticity and neruon exitability
3. ATP - coupling between astrocytes via Ca2+ wave

exocytosis mediate one of the pathways of gliotransmission: 

- SNARE complex formation is possible in astrocytes, as they experss the core machinery proteins involved in this 
    + synaptobrevin II 
    + SNAP-23
    + Munc19
    + complexin 2 
    + synaptotagmin IV, required for Ca2+ regulated vesicular gliotransmission


Glutamate 

Evidence that glutamate is released by astrocytes: 

- high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that bradykinin-evoked Ca2+ signalling was followed by release of glutamate from astrocytes (Parpura 1994, Nature)

Key roles of glutamate release by astrocytes: 

- the **cystine/glutamate transporter** is relevant in addiction 
    + uptake of cystine (and glutamate out) --> synthesis of glutathione 
    + withdrawal from cocaine leads to reduction of extracellular glutamate in nucleus accumbens due to reduced activity of transporter
    + direct infusion of cystine or systemic adminstration of N-acetylcystine, both of which activates the transporter (to uptake cystine and export glutamate), prevented relapse. (this is actually quite interesting) (Baker 2003 Nat. Neurosci.)
- the cystine/glutamate transporter is also relevant in the brain tumour **glioblastoma multiforme** 
    + gliomal cell -> increased extracellular glutmate --> exocytotic death of neurons (clear space for tumour growth? that's evil)
    + evidence: inhibition of transporter leads to rapid depetion of glutathion and reduction in tumour growths (Sontheimer 2008 J. Neuro)
- targeting **NR2B-containing NMDA receptors** by glutamate modulates neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission 
    + modulation form 1: discrete transient slow-inward currents (SICs)
    + modulation form 2: tonic modulation
    + BUT what is the function of these currents? 
    + glutamatergic gliotranmission also increase frequency of EPSCs in nearby neurons 

There are some debates about glutamatergic gliotransmission (is it really happening? And is it functional?)

- neurochemical concern 
    + astrocytes metabolise glutamate to glutamine via glutamine synthetase, so is there even enough glutamate for gliotransmission? 
    + one argument against this says there is enough, end of discussion (paper mention because astrocytes are "living", how is that even an argument, I guess they just mean the glutamate in/out flow is dynamic, therefore there is enough)
    + second arguemnt against: $K_m$ (rate constant?) of glutamate transporter is lower than glutamine synthetase (ie. rate of in higher than conversion), therefore okay 
- machinery concern - do astrocytes have the molecules needed for glutamatergic gliotransmission
    + there is good support that the machinery is sufficient 
    + including glutamate transporters, SNARE proteins, synaptotagmin IV 
    + both in vitro and in vivo 
    + BUT two studies using microarrays did not detect message for vesicular glutamate transpoters (what is this "message" they speak of?)
- Ca2+ sianglling regualte both microvessels constriction/dilation and gliotransmission 
    + not all Ca2+ signal initiate gliotransmission; the mechanism may be more complicated than previously assume (Shigetomi 2008 J. Neuro)


(I have skipped over some part here... may return later)

D-Serine 

A review of how NMDA work: 

- *coincidence* between glutamate binding and depolarisation
- depolarisation relives the default Mg2+ ion block at the receptor pore 
- receptor activity is also regulated by a **glycine binding site**
    + **D-serine** is an endogenous ligand (what does this mean?) for this site 

Astrocyte synthesise and release D-serine: 

- synthesise by **serine racemase** expressed in astrocytes 
- released in a Ca^2+^-dependent manner

What is the function of this type of D-serine releaese? 

- regulate NMDA receptor function 
- regulate synaptic plasticity (LTD and LTP)
- may be responsibel for metaplasticity 
    + astrocytic ensheathment of synapse (ie. wrapping of astrocytes around of synapse) is reduced during lactation 
    + less D-serine provided to NMDA 
    + this increases LTD 
    + whereas opposite occurs in virgin rodents 


ATP 

What is the function of astrocyte releasing ATP? 

- coupling between astrocytes 
- may also be used to signal to neurons

Evidence: 

- high-resolution cell culture show that ATP is the signal **mediating Ca2+ wave** (Guthrie 1999 J. Neurosciences)



## Essays 

### Disuss how recent research on glial cells is challenging classical notions of information processing in the CNS (2016) 

My plan to approach this: 

- define what are the classical notions of informatino processing
    + mostly neurons doing the processing
    + glial cell mostly support cells, no processing going on there
- describe new research and their conclusions
